## Abstract
This project explores the development of predictive models for estimating the selling price of used cars. Using features like car name, buying year, kilometers driven, fuel type, and present price, the project applies **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regression** to build and evaluate models. Performance metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** are used to compare the models. Additionally, the Random Forest model's feature importance analysis highlights significant predictors.

## Introduction
The used car market is influenced by various factors that determine the selling price of vehicles. This project aims to analyze these factors and develop models to predict prices effectively. 

The project workflow includes:
- **Data preprocessing** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.
- Model building using **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regression**.
- Performance evaluation using statistical metrics.

By understanding the predictive capabilities of these models, the study provides insights for future enhancements and real-world applications.
